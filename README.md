# pands-project 
# This is the project that I analyse Iris Data set and present what the data set which includes the interesting points in data set

# Include calculate the avarage, the standard diviation and python code in this project 

# Deadline is 28th April 23:59

# Googled Fisher's Iris data set and adapted raw data from [link to Google](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv) , saved as csv file and saved on my desktop>iris-data-set. Deleted the 1st line and saved it again.

# About the Iris data-set

# Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962) is a British statitian and geneticist who is famous for population genetics. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) 

# Poplulation genetics is "the study of genetic variation within populations, and involves the examination and modelling of changes in the frequencies of genes and alleles in populations over space and time." [link](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/vgec/highereducation/topics/population-genetics)

#Iris data set has three classes of 50 samples which were all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) A major founding of this data is one class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

# attribute of data set is below.
# 1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. class: 
-- Iris Setosa 
-- Iris Versicolour 
-- Iris Virginica
