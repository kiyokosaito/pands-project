# pands-project 
##### This is the project that I analyse Iris Data set and present what the data set which includes the interesting points in data set

##### Include calculate the avarage, the standard diviation and python code in this project 

##### Deadline is 28th April 23:59

##### 06-04-2019
##### Googled Fisher's Iris data set and adapted raw data from [link to Google](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv) , saved as csv file and saved on my desktop>iris-data-set. Deleted the 1st line and saved it again.

# About the Iris data-set

### Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962) is a British statitian and geneticist who is famous for population genetics. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) 

### Poplulation genetics is "the study of genetic variation within populations, and involves the examination and modelling of changes in the frequencies of genes and alleles in populations over space and time." [link](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/vgec/highereducation/topics/population-genetics)

### Iris data set has three classes of 50 samples which were all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) A major founding of this data is one class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

##### attribute of data set is below.
##### 1. sepal length in cm 
##### 2. sepal width in cm 
##### 3. petal length in cm 
##### 4. petal width in cm 
#####  -- Iris Setosa 
#####  -- Iris Versicolour 
#####  -- Iris Virginica

### Initial examination of the samples which I adapted raw data from github link above.

### By just looking at the attributes of samples, 1 distinctive noticable difference can be found.

### Setosa is clearly different from other two irises in regards to petal length and petal width. This project will show how Setosa is different from other two irises visually with python codes.

### First I will write codes the maximum, minumum and mean of each column and study what they are and gathered all these 3 values as csv file. Here is the screenshot of these values in csv file.

### These codes to calculate average, minimum and max of each colums are included in each python codes. 

### As you can see, the average of 3 types of iris is about a palm size and not more than bigger than a whole hand size. 

# Scatter charts to show a distinctive noticible difference

### I adapted the python codes from [link](https://ameblo.jp/cognitive-solution/entry-12265630846.html) to show the distinctive difference by choosing two attributes to show 2D chart. Petal length and width are picked in this chart.

### Next chart picked sepal and petal width and also python codes is adapted from the same link as above and slightly chenged the colum numbers.

### Next chart picked sepal length and width. Again, python codes is adapted and modified from the same link above.

# Conclution of the project

### As I mentioned earlier, without analysing dataset by computing system, one of iris was noticably different to other 2 irises. By choosing 2 attributes (2D) to show how the difference with visual charts shows this noticible difference very easlisy. Even it is same species, by taking samples and analysing them closely with computing system shows how different these 3 types.
